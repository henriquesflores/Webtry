                About this site
            </h2>
            <p>
            This personal website archives my notes. </br>
            My main interests are Machine Learning, Probability theory and
            Computer science. </br>
            Notes can be either studying material on subjects that I wish
            to master </br>
            Or some research problems that I have been interest into </br>

            This blog originated on a mixed ambitious idea of 
            trying to write about these topics and possibly learn from
            others.</br>

            Very interested in modelling non-stationary time series such 
            as self-driving cars, speech recognition and 
            market modelling</br>

                About me
            </h2>
            <p>
            I am Henrique Flores, a quantitative analyst&#47;data scientist at
            M. Safra &amp; Co. 
            I hold a PhD in theoretical physics from IFT-UNESP;</br>
            I am very interested in computer science and firmly believe
            that C is the best language ever invented &mdash; which does
            not imply that any other language does not have useful features</br>
            I also program in R, Python and Mathematica. Currently starting on
            Julia. I plan to use evetually all these languages in posts
            whatever I feel like</br>
